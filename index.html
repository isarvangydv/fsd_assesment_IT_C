        This Springy Bounce cushioning ensures comfort through even the most gruelling sessions. The tooling The Shank was created by using data from hundreds of runners. That data helped to design shank which offers different angles of support placed where you need it. It supports explosive movement in any direction. The higher degree of flexibility is one of the main benefits of this type of sole and provides better shock absorption. Non-marking rubber outsole for excellent grip and grooves on the sole make it flexible. Rubber at the forefoot and heel gives you the durability to keep going.</p>
